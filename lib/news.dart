        'MLB rumors: Red Sox negotiating extension with young starting pitcher, Yankees haven\'t started talks yet',
    content: '''
Major League Baseball's regular season will begin in less than a month. The uneven, at times non-existent pace of the offseason means that some clubs still have shopping to do before they can get their seasons going. In turn, that necessitates that we continue to track all of the latest news, notes, and rumors from the day that was. Below, you'll find Wednesday's assortment. 

Yankees yet to approach Holmes, Torres about extensions
The Yankees have not engaged reliever Clay Holmes in extension talks ahead of his walk year, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post. Ditto for second baseman Gleyber Torres, who told reporters on Wednesday that he wants to be a "Yankee for life," per Pete Caldera of the Bergen Record.

Holmes, 30, is entering his third full season with the Yankees. In 153 appearances to date, he's compiled a 2.50 ERA (167 ERA+) and a 3.62 strikeout-to-walk ratio. He's also collected 44 saves the last two years, and was selected for the 2022 All-Star Game. Torres, for his part, turned 27 in December and has hit for a career 115 OPS+ while making two All-Star Games. Both players are expected to be ranked in the top 25 of next winter's free-agent class if they are permitted to test the waters.

        'Eric Hosmer retires: Gold Glover best remembered for 2015 Royals World Series calls it quits after 13 seasons',
    content: '''
Longtime big-league first baseman Eric Hosmer announced his retirement on Wednesday at the same time he launched a new podcast venture called MoonBall Media.

Hosmer, 34, spent 31 games with the Chicago Cubs last season before being released in May. That stretch, as it turns out, will mark the end of a 13-year career that saw him bat .276/.335/.427 (107 OPS+) with 198 home runs and an estimated 18.6 Wins Above Replacement, according to the calculations hosted at Baseball Reference. 

Hosmer spent seven seasons with the Kansas City Royals, who originally drafted him with the third pick in 2008. He arrived as part of a promising young core alongside Mike Moustakas, Alex Gordon, Lorenzo Cain, and Salvador Pérez that helped form one of the best farm systems in recent memory. Hosmer himself was ranked as a top-10 prospect by Baseball America in spring 2011.

Hosmer may not have lived up to the loftiest of projections that were placed upon him in his younger days, but he won four Gold Glove Awards and a Silver Slugger Award. He was also named the MVP of the 2016 All-Star Game, the only one he was selected for. Hosmer will perhaps best be remembered in Kansas City for his baserunning heroics during the 2015 World Series.

        'Matt Chapman free agency: Three reasons why Gold Glover remains on the market as Opening Day nears',
    content: '''
The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres will begin Major League Baseball's 2024 regular season in less than a month's time, when they engage in a two-game series in Seoul, South Korea on March 20-21. Some notable remaining free agents can only hope that they've found a home before the Dodgers and Padres take the field. Indeed, four of CBS Sports' top 10 free agents remain unsigned: lefties Blake Snell and Jordan Montgomery, outfielder Cody Bellinger, and third baseman Matt Chapman.

Of the quartet, Chapman might be the least examined on a national level. Snell is a multi-time Cy Young Award winner; Bellinger is a former MVP Award recipient whose rollercoaster career has earned him notoriety; and Montgomery spent most of his career with the New York Yankees and emerged as a key actor in the Texas Rangers' World Series victory. Chapman, by comparison, is best known for his time with the Oakland Athletics. He hasn't made an All-Star Game or received MVP consideration since 2019. Those achievements will soon, we regret to note, be five years in the past.

Still, Chapman's game looks mighty impressive on paper. He's coming off a four-win season with the Blue Jays that solidified a top-50 rank in Wins Above Replacement over the last three years. He's a four-time Gold Glove Award-winning third baseman. He's clobbered at least 25 home runs in three of the last four regulation-length seasons. Oh, and he's reliably played in 140 or more games throughout his big-league career. Put it all together and you have a high-quality player. So, why hasn't anyone signed him? 

Below, CBS Sports has highlighted three factors that may have contributed to Chapman's chilly winter.

        'Former Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera elected mayor of \'beloved\' hometown in Dominican Republic',
    content: '''
The Kansas City Royals won a World Series in 2015 behind a stellar bullpen that included arms like Kelvin Herrera and Greg Holland. Following his retirement from the sport, Herrera has found another career path.

According to Diario Libre, Herrera has been elected as the mayor of Tenares, a town in the Dominican Republic. Herrera received 49.8 percent of the vote as he defeated Fabiola Gonzalez, who earned 46.2 percent of the vote.

"The time has come to work, to work for my beloved town, for its beautification and organization," Herrera said, via Diario Libre. "The time has come to show my gratitude with the work, with the change towards a different Tenares, a better Tenares."

Herrera, who played 10 MLB seasons, broke into the league with the Royals back in 2011 after being signed by the franchise as an international free agent. The right-hander played in Kansas City for two seasons and earned two All-Star Game appearances during that time. Herrera tallied a 2.75 ERA and 57 saves with the Royals.

Herrera was traded to the Washington Nationals in 2018, while also pitching for the Chicago White Sox during his final two seasons in 2019 and 2020.

In his career, Herrera recorded a 1.26 ERA and 38 strikeouts in the postseason. He ended up tossing three scoreless innings in Game 5 of the 2015 World Series, which ended up clinching the title for the Royals.

        'Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow expected to start first two 2024 Dodgers games during Seoul Series',
    content: '''
The Los Angeles Dodgers will begin Major League Baseball's regular season in less than a month's time when they take on the San Diego Padres in a two-game set in Seoul, South Korea on March 20-21. While things can change between now and then, the Dodgers could use those games to showcase most of their star offseason additions.

Manager Dave Roberts told reporters on Tuesday that right-handers Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Tyler Glasnow are on schedule to start those contests. 

"This is a unique ramp-up for everyone," Roberts said during the Cactus League's media availability day, according to ESPN's Alden Gonzalez. "It's two games that matter, but it's just two games. So the entirety of the season and making sure these guys are ready to take down starts -- that's most important."

Yamamoto, of course, would be making his MLB debut after signing a 12-year pact worth \$325 million during the offseason. He is, without question, the most accomplished active pitcher in the world to have not appeared in a MLB contest. During his time in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league, Yamamoto won three consecutive Most Valuable Player and Eiji Sawamura (think NPB's Cy Young equivalent) Awards.

        'Ranking 10 players returning from injury who could impact playoff races, including Mike Trout, Edwin Díaz',
    content: '''
Spring training camps are underway across Arizona and Florida, and Cactus League and Grapefruit League games aren't too far off. Real live baseball is right around the corner, and with actual games soon to be played, teams across the league are looking forward to welcoming back players who missed most or all of last season with injuries. 

Injuries are an unfortunate part of the game and sometimes they rob a team of an important piece, altering the trajectory of their season. When an injury happens, all you can do is adjust on the fly and try to overcome it, like the Rangers did when they won the World Series last year despite losing Jacob deGrom to Tommy John surgery in June.

Several players will return from long-term injuries this season and make an impact on the postseason races. The best recent example is Justin Verlander. He had Tommy John surgery in 2020, then when he returned in 2022, he won the AL Cy Young and led the Astros to a World Series championship. It's hard to come back from an injury and have more impact than that.

With that in mind, let's look at players expected to return from major injuries this year who could give their clubs a significant lift and be a factor in the postseason race. We're going to focus on players who missed a large portion of 2023 and either finished the season on the injured list, or were a non-factor late in the year.

        'Ranking five MLB teams that could make 2024 postseason after missing out on playoffs completely in 2023',
    content: '''
Spring training is well underway, and soon, Cactus League and Grapefruit League games will begin. Exhibition games are fun in their own way, but let's be real here: they get boring pretty quickly. We all crave high-stakes baseball, as the stakes are never higher than in the postseason. And with the 12-team format, there have never been more postseason games.

Last year, six teams qualified for the playoffs after failing to reach the postseason in 2022, including the World Series champion Texas Rangers and National League champion Arizona Diamondbacks. Under the old 10-team postseason format, roughly half the field changed from one year to the next, so last year's six new postseason teams had the same turnover rate.

R.J. Anderson already looked at the five 2023 postseason teams most in danger of missing the 2024 postseason. We're here to do the opposite. We're going to look at the five teams best positioned to make the 2024 postseason after failing to make it in 2023 because they improved their roster over the winter, are healthier, face less stiff competition in their division, etc.

Here, ranked in order of most likely to make the postseason after missing last year, are the five teams in the best shape to make the 2024 postseason after spending last October at home.

Spring training is here for MLB teams, and it didn't take long for an errant ball to find someone's window. Cincinnati Reds star Elly De La Cruz smashed a foul ball off teammate Hunter Greene's car on Tuesday.

According to Mike Petraglia of CLNS Media, De La Cruz was taking live batting practice against Greene when he fouled a pitch straight back. The ball sailed over the fence and landed directly on the rear window of Green's luxury SUV.

        'MLB free agent tracker: Cody Bellinger, Blake Snell, Matt Chapman remain on market as spring training begins',
    content: '''
Pitchers and catchers are starting to report to MLB spring training, and 2024 Opening Day is fast approaching. Yet plenty of notable MLB free agents remain on the market, which has been slow to develop this offseason. There were a handful of notable signings in January. The Brewers recently signed slugger Rhys Hoskins, the Astros bolstered their bullpen with a five-year deal for Josh Hader and Justin Turner is heading north of the border to join the Blue Jays.

The Twins kicked off February by agreeing to a deal with Carlos Santana, the Brewers have landed veteran catcher Gary Sánchez and Clayton Kershaw is sticking with the Dodgers. Slugger Jorge Soler, meanwhile is heading to the heart of San Francisco's lineup while Amed Rosario will help round out the Rays' infield.

Four of CBS Sports' top 10 free agents remain unsigned, however, and 11 of our top 50 free agents are still figuring out where they'll play in 2024. That group includes Cody Bellinger, Blake Snell, Jordan Montgomery and J.D. Martinez.

You can check out our top 50 free agent list, including write-ups on every player, here. CBS Sports will be keeping track of the top 50 free agents on the market below.
